19. Design Pizza Pricing System - Followup

Implement low level design of pizza pricing system.
System should support initializing a new pizza, adding toppings to it and calculating final price of pizza.

There are also going to be more followup buisness rules that your system should support.
Toppings Catalog (With Per-Serving Cost in units)
Topping	Cost per serving
cheeseburst	100
corn	50
onion	30
capsicum	50
pineapple	60
mushroom	40
Business Rules for adding toppings that your system must follow:
cheeseburst
Cheeseburst is considered unhealthy food and attracts more tax.
If at least one serving of cheeseburst is present, increase the pizza’s entire tax rate by +30% of its current value
Example: base tax 10 → 10 + 0.30 × 10 = 13.
Additional cheeseburst servings do not further change tax.
Max 1 serving of cheeseburst can be added on pizza size "small" ,
maximum 2 servings for pizza size "medium"
cheeseburst cannot be added if mushroom is already present.
pineapple
pineapple is allowed only on pizza sizes "medium" and "large".
mushroom
mushroom is considered healthy food and it cannot be added if cheeseburst is already present
If at least one serving of mushroom is present, decrease the pizza’s entire tax rate by +10% of its current value
Example: base tax 10 → 10 - 0.10 × 10 = 9.
Additional mushroom servings do not further change tax.
corn
For "medium" pizza first serving costs 50; each additional serving costs 40.
For "large" pizza each serving including the first serving costs 20.
Your implementation should make it easy to add more new rules later (for example, size-based caps, combos, promos) .
Use decorator design pattern .

Constructor and Methods
PizzaPricing(int basePrice, int taxPercentage, String size)
		
100 ≤ basePrice ≤ 10000, and basePrice will always be a multiple of 100.

0 ≤ taxPercentage ≤ 1000 1000% tax means tax is 10 times the base price of pizza.
i.e. if base price is 200 units and tax 1000 and no toppings are there,
then final price = 200+ tax = 200* 1000% of 200 = 200 + 1000/100 * 200 = 2,200/- units
Another example: basePrice = 200 units, taxPercentage = 18% then,
Final price = 200 + 18/100 * 200 =200+36 = 236 units.

size is one of "small", "medium", "large".

All constructor inputs are guaranteed to be valid.
Methods
boolean addTopping(String topping, int servingsCount)
servingsCount is a valid positive integer.
Returns true if the topping is applied (passes all rules); otherwise false and no state change.
int getFinalPrice()
Returns the final price rounded to int using Round Half Up (see rounding).
Can be called any time.
Pricing and Tax Model
Subtotal = basePrice + Σ(topping costs actually applied)
Taxable Base = Subtotal
Tax Rate starts at the constructor-supplied taxPercentage. Rules can make it fractional (for example, +30% of current tax).
Tax Amount = (Tax Rate / 100) × Subtotal
Final Price (pre-round) = Subtotal + Tax Amount
Rounding Rule (Round Half Up)
To convert final price to int: (int)(x + 0.5).

4.6 → 5; 4.51 → 5; 4.49 → 4; 4.5 → 5
Notes:

Adding a topping that violates a rule returns false and leaves the pizza unchanged.
Tax uplift from cheeseburst applies once, regardless of additional cheeseburst servings.
All calculations use decimals internally; rounding to int occurs only in getFinalPrice().
Examples
Example A - Small pizza: cheeseburst uplift, size cap, pineapple restriction
   Create pizza
PizzaPricing p = new PizzaPricing(200, 10, "small");

  Add toppings
p.addTopping("cheeseburst", 1);   // true, tax 10 → 13 (one-time uplift)
p.addTopping("cheeseburst", 1);   // false, exceeds cheeseburst cap for "small" (max 1)
p.addTopping("pineapple", 1);     // false, pineapple not allowed on "small"
p.addTopping("onion", 2);         // true (2 × 30)

   Compute final price
int price = p.getFinalPrice();    // 407

   Calculation: base=200; toppings=100 + 2×30=160; subtotal=360;
   tax=13% of 360=46.8; final=406.8 → round half up ⇒ 407
Example B - Medium pizza: mushroom tax decrease, corn tiered pricing, mutual exclusion
// Create pizza
PizzaPricing q = new PizzaPricing(350, 8, "medium");

   Add toppings
q.addTopping("mushroom", 1);      // true; tax 8 → 7.2 (one-time 10% decrease)
q.addTopping("corn", 3);          // true; medium pricing: 50 + 40 + 40 = 130
q.addTopping("cheeseburst", 1);   // false; blocked (mushroom already present)

   Compute final price
int price = q.getFinalPrice();    // 557

     Calculation: base=350; toppings=40 + 130=170; subtotal=520;
     tax=7.2% of 520=37.44; final=557.44 → round half up ⇒ 557
Example C - Large pizza: pineapple allowed, corn flat pricing on large
// Create pizza
PizzaPricing r = new PizzaPricing(900, 15, "large");

    Add toppings
r.addTopping("pineapple", 2);     // true (2 × 60)
r.addTopping("corn", 4);          // true; large pricing: 4 × 20 = 80
r.addTopping("onion", 1);         // true (1 × 30)

    Compute final price
int price = r.getFinalPrice();    // 1300

    Calculation: base=900; toppings=120 + 80 + 30=230; subtotal=1130;
   tax=15% of 1130=169.5; final=1299.5 → round half up ⇒ 1300
